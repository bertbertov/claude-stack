# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Skip

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks
